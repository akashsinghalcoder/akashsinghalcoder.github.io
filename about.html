<p style="text-align: center;">Hey!!!!Thanks for visiting &#9786; <br>To start with, I was born and brought up in Delhi therefore I am typical Delhiite who are generous species,fearless and we are big time foodies!. Challenging status quo is the skill which has been inherited. </p>
<p>I am third year B-Tech student majoring in Information Technologies from Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering Paschim Vihar, GGISPU. Currently as a fresher, I am looking for summer internship where I can contribute towards the development of software product which is being used by millions round the world. As a college student, I have a mix of both-logical and explorative mind and thus I like to explore various fields like Phychology, Philosophy, Business models of various companies and thus want to bridge the gap between manual work involved in various fields and software. </p>
<p>I did my schooling from S.R. DAV PUBLIC SCHOOL DAYANAND VIHAR. My background includes strong Software engineering concepts along with strong hold on core subjects of computer science. But let's not discuss too much about technical skills in this section. So I really would like to present some aspects of my approach towards work which I strongly consider a factor that separates me from others. I always aim for enhancing my skill set by learning while doing therefore introspection towards my work each and every day is one of the most important activities of my daily routine. I like to engage in brainstorming sessions to solve day-to-day problems.
I have always been an average student academically with good practical knowledge of subjects therefore I am still in pursuit of success with the hope that my practical approach will bring me success and it will continue for the lifetime.<br>
